Description:
------------

QuickRecon is a simple information gathering tool that allows you to:
- bruteforce subdomains
- perform zone transfer
- gather email addresses from 'google.com', 'groups.google.com' and 'bing.com'
- find human relationships using XHTML Friends Network
- check a host (IP) in Shodan search engine database



Requires:
---------

GUI in 'QuickRecon' is based on 'PyQt4' toolkit <http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/> written by Phil Thompson.
'Relationships' mode requires HTML/XML parser 'BeautifulSoup' <http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/> written by Leonard Richardson.
'Zone transfer' mode depends on DNS toolkit 'dnspython' <http://www.dnspython.org/> written by Bob Halley.
To use 'Shodan' mode you need 'shodan-python' library <https://github.com/achillean/shodan-python/> primary written by John Matherly.

Tested on Windows 7 and Kubuntu 11.04 with Python 2.7.2.



Note:
-----

An API key is required to access the Shodan database, get yours at <http://www.shodanhq.com/account/login> for free.
Key can be stored in the 'shodan_key.cfg' file or directly entered in the GUI.
